expires news in the
.B sn
news system, one article file (=10 articles, compile time default)
at a time.
.B snexpire
always leaves behind at least one article file, so that newly
entered articles will have numbers not overlapping previously used
numbers.  As an exception if the expiration age is set to 0,
then even this last file will be expired and subsequent article
numbers will start from the beginning.
You will need to be root or own !!SNROOT!! to run
.BR snexpire .
