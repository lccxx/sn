Some thoughts that haven't been tested, but should be workable.  Why
include it here?  Because if you do this, I'd like to hear about it
even if you have no problems.

Aliasing of newsgroup names.
If group.alias is a symlink to group.real, which is a newsgroup directory,
then all functions that apply to group.real (posting, fetching, etc.)
apply equally to group.alias as group.real.  EXCEPT in reading articles,
when the newsgroup name is group.alias, whereas it should be group.real.
