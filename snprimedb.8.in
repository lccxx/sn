.SH NAME
snprimedb \- feed the sn database.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B snprimedb
.RB [- i ]
(no arguments)
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B snprimedb
reads records from its standard input and enters them into the database.
The database is appended to; if you want to start a new database,
you would delete the database files
.IR .chain , \ .table , \ .newsgroup
before running this program.

The main purpose of
.B snprimedb
is to rebuild the ID database.  Then its input is usually obtained
from
.BR snscan .

If the option
.RB - i
is given, simply initialize the database files if they do not exist,
and exit.

Input lines are of the format
.br
.I newsgroup id serial
where
.I newsgroup
is the newsgroup the article may be found in,
.I id
is its message id, and
.I serial
is the local serial number of that article in that newsgroup.
If
.I newsgroup
is the special name
.BR =junk ,
then the whole line is ignored.

You will need to be root or the owner of !!SNROOT!! to do this.

.SH BUGS
.B snprimedb
does not check to see that the articles really exist.  Also the size
of the hash table is fixed at compile time.

Under degenerate conditions, the hash table file
.I .chain
(see below) could
grow very large, with reclaimed space remaining unused.  This is due
to the very simple file space allocator, which doesn't know how to
coalesce adjacent free areas.  It doesn't know how to split them either.
The allocator assumes that the shape of the distribution of record lengths
remains quite constant over time.

The hash table database doesn't make any attempt to reduce its
footprint.  This should be acceptable, since the database is shared.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.TP
.B SNROOT
If this is set and is not empty, the value is used in place of
.BR !!SNROOT!! ,
the default news spool directory.

.SH FILES
.TP
.RI !!SNROOT!! /.table
.B snprimedb
uses this file as the index of the hash table, and ...

.TP
.RI !!SNROOT!! /.chain
as the hash chains, and ...

.TP
.RI !!SNROOT!! /.newsgroup
to attach an integer identifier to each newsgroup name.
This file is a human-readable flat text file.
