#!!!BASH!!
# This is a SAMPLE .outgoing file suitable for use in a local
# newsgroup to feed to a mailing list.
#
# You MUST edit this before copying it into news.group/.outgoing.
# You must set at least LISTADDRESS and SENDMAIL:

# Invocation environment:
# Current directory will be $SNROOT if set else !!SNROOT!!.
# The article is available on descriptor 0, in wire format.
# If TCPREMOTEIP and TCPLOCALIP are set, that is the dotted-quad IP
# of the posting host and server (us) respectively.
# NEWSGROUP is set to this local newsgroup's name.
# The script must exit 0 to indicate it has successfully handled the
# article, or non-0 to indicate failure.

LISTADDRESS=postmaster                     # mailing list address
SENDMAIL="/var/qmail/bin/qmail-inject"     # Running qmail?
#SENDMAIL="/usr/lib/sendmail $LISTADDRESS" # Running sendmail?
#
# If you're using qmail, you can set these:
#
# QMAILSUSER=postmaster       # For envelope sender
# QMAILSHOST=                 # Ditto
# export QMAILSUSER QMAILSHOST
#
# Otherwise, if you're using sendmail, you could set these:
#
# LOGNAME=postmaster
# HOSTNAME=
# export LOGNAME HOSTNAME

#
# Real work begins here.  This turns a news article into
# something suitable for mail.
