In the examples in INSTALL.run, you may want to run "snauth" instead
of "snntpd ...". Snauth would only allow authorized users to read
and will allow all authorized users to post (so you do not have
to set POSTING_OK yourself). Snauth uses PAM for authentication -
make sure your /etc/pam.d/sn is reasonable.

To compile, move snauth.c to the main code directory, apply the patch
(patch < contrib/pam_authentication/patch), and run "make".

This code was written by Aleksey Nogin <aleksey@nogin.org>.
