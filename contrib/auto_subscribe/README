I'm sending you a script that can be run as a cron job, to
automatically subscribe to newsgroups, based on a pattern file. The
patterns are used to make an initial group selection, and to decide
whether to subscribe to new groups. For instance, when you create the
following pattern file:

- *.advocacy
+ comp.os.*

you will automatically be subscribed to all current and future
comp.os.* groups, except for *.advocacy groups. If you like, you
can include the script as an example in the sn distribution.
