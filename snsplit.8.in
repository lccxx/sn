.SH NAME
snsplit \- split an article stream into individual articles
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B snsplit
.RI [- r ]
.RI [ field ...\ -]
.IR prog ...
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B snsplit
reads an article stream from descriptor 0 and splits it into separate
articles, invoking
.IR prog ...
on each, with the article avaiable on descriptor 0.  This is useful
as a quick-and-dirty way of filtering an article stream.

The incoming article stream is expected to be in wire format, with
lines ending in CRLF, leading dots doubled, and
delimited by a dot on a line by itself.

The article presented to
.IR prog ...
will have lines that end in a bare newline, will have all header
lines unfolded, leading dots will be unstuffed, and the article
will be terminated by end-of-file.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.IR prog ...
is the program (with arguments) to run on each article.  If
.IR prog ...
exits with any kind of failure,
.B snsplit
aborts.

.TP
.IR field ...-
are optional header field names.  If these are specified, the value
of the first header field of that name will be exported into the
environment.  This
.IR field ...
list must be terminated by the hyphen.  See also
.B ENVIRONMENT
below.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.RB - r
Expect input articles in rnews batch format instead.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.B snsplit
sets some environment variables.  If the environment already
contains these variables, they will be overwritten.

.TP
.B SEQUENCE
If already set to a positive value, it is incremented for the first
article.  If it isn't set, is set to one for the first
article.  Thereafter it is incremented for each subsequent article.
The value is always a 6-digit number with leading zeroes, and it can
roll over.
.TP
.B BYTES
contains the size of the current article.
.TP
.B HEAD_LINES
The number of lines in the head of the article, excluding the blank
separator line.
.TP
.B BODY_LINES
The number of lines in the body of the article, excluding the blank
separator line.
.TP
.BI FLD_ FIELD
If any
.IR field s
are specified on the command line, where
.I field
is the name of an article header field, then
.BI FLD_ FIELD
will be set to the value of
.IR field ,
where
.I FIELD
is the same as
.I field
but with lower case characters changed to upper case, and all
hyphens changed to underscores.  Confusing?  If
.I field
is
.BR message-id ,
then
.B FLD_MESSAGE_ID
will be set to the value of the first Message-ID field in the
current article, if there is one.

.SH EXIT CODES
.B snsplit
exits 0 on success, 1 on usage error, 2 on system error, and 3 on
article format error.  If
.IR prog ...
exits with other than 0,
.B snsplit
will also exit that value.
