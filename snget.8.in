.TH snget,v!!VERSION!! 8 "Harold Tay" "N.B." \" -*- nroff -*-
.SH NAME
snget,sngetd \- fetch news from upstream sites and store them locally.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B snget
.RI [ options ]
.RI [ news.group ...]
.br
.B sngetd
.RI [ options ]
.br
.IR options :
.RI [- d ]
.RI [- h\ Bps ]
.RI [- p\ nparallel ]
.RI [- c\ depth ]
.RI [- m\ max ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B snget
fetches articles for the
.IR news.group s
on the command line (or all non-local newsgroups if none are
specified) from their respective upstream feeds, and stores them
in the news spool !!SNROOT!!.  If a newsgroup could not be fetched for,
it may be attempted again.
.B sngetd
does the same, except it reads newsgroup names from
.RB !!SNROOT!!/ .fifo
and does not exit.
.B sngetd
does not fork into the background.

.B snget
does not guarantee to fetch the groups in the order specified on the
command line.
.B snget
and
.B sngetd
will write errors and status messages to descriptor 2.

.B snget
and
.B sngetd
are both scheduling wrappers that call
.RB !!BINDIR!!/ SNHELLO ,
.BR snfetch ,
and
.BR snstore .
You must own !!SNROOT!! or be root in order to run
.B snget
and
.BR sngetd .

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.RI - d
Enable verbosity, may be specified multiple times.  This option is
also propagated to
.B snfetch
and
.BR snstore .

.TP
.RI - p\ nparallel
Attempt to fetch for
.I nparallel
newsgroups at once.  Default is 4, maximum is 8.

.TP
.RI - h\ Bps
Throttle the sum of bandwidth used by all
.BR snfetch es
to
.I Bps
bytes per second.  This option is used to prevent
.B snget
or
.B sngetd
from hogging the network.  By default there is no throttling.

.TP
.RI - c\ depth
.I depth
is passed to
.B snfetch
as the depth of the command pipeline.

.TP
.RI - m\ max
The very first time contacting the news server, retrieve no more
than
.I max
articles per newsgroup, default is 200.  This option is useful only
if there are unprimed newsgroups and has no effect otherwise.  The
.B .max
file in each newsgroup directory still applies (see
.BR snfetch (8)).

.TP
.RI - t\ timeout
This option is not documented because it is ignored and will
disappear in a future release.  See
.B .timeout
in
.B FILES
next.

.SH FILES
.TP
.B Server Directories
These are the directories
.RI !!SNROOT!!/.outgoing/ server.name:port ,
which are symlinked from
.RI !!SNROOT!!/ news.group /.outgoing.
If the latter isn't a (symlink to a) directory,
.B snget
won't fetch for
.IR news.group .

.TP
.RI !!SNROOT!!/.outgoing/ server.name:port /.timeout
If this file exists and contains a number, this is taken to be the
timeout in seconds in all dealings with
.IR server.name:port .
Default is 120 seconds.

.TP
.RI !!SNROOT!!/.outgoing/ server.name:port /.SNHELLO
If this program file exists, it is invoked instead of the default
(usually
.RB !!BINDIR!!/ SNHELLO )
when an NNTP connection is first made to
.I server.name:port
in order to read the greeting and upload posted articles.  If
.I server.name:port
requires a username and password, you would copy the default here
and edit that information in.

.TP
.RI !!SNROOT!!/ news.group /{.serial,.max}
.B snget
and
.B sngetd
read these files on behalf of
.BR snfetch .

.SH SIGNALS
Other signals have default behaviour.
.TP
.B SIGUSR1
If
.RI - h\ Bps
was specified,
.I Bps
is halved, else is ignored.
.TP
.B SIGUSR2
If
.RI - h\ Bps
was specified,
.I Bps
is doubled, else is ignored.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
See also
.RB !!BINDIR!!/ SNHELLO
for the list of environment variables exported by
.BR snget / sngetd .
.TP
.B SNROOT
If this is set and is not empty, the value is used in place of
.BR !!SNROOT!! ,
the default news spool directory.

.TP
.B PATH
To find
.B SNHELLO
(if this server does not have a
.BR .SNHELLO ),
.BR snfetch ,
and
.BR snstore .
If
.B PATH
does not contain !!BINDIR!! as one of it's components, !!BINDIR!! is
appended to it.
