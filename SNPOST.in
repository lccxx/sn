#!!!BASH!!
#
# This script is invoked by snntpd in response to the POST command.
# Basically it forwards any cancel requests, and invokes snsend on
# the others.  It augments snsend by checking for newsgroups for
# which posting is not permitted.  This script's simple-minded idea
# of access control is determined by the presence or absence of the
# .nopost file in the newsgroup directories.  Obviously there's a lot
# of flexibility if you want to do more sophisticated access control.
#
# Invocation environment:
# Article to be posted will be available on descriptor 0.
# $NEWSGROUPS will always contain a non-empty space-separated list
# of newsgroups to which the article is posted.
# If the article is a control message, $CONTROL will be set to the
# value of the Control field.
# $TCPREMOTEIP and $TCPLOCALIP will be set to the posting client's IP
# and the local server IP, if invoked from the network.
# Current directory will always be the appropriate sn spool
# directory, $SNROOT if set, otherwise !!SNROOT!!.
# PATH will always contain !!BINDIR!!.
# The exit status gets translated into the NNTP response code;
# the output (if any) becomes the text of the NNTP response.
#

fail () { echo "$@"; exit 9; }

#
# Is it a control message?  Notify owner and let her verify the
# request.  I won't make auto-cancellation the default.
# If you don't want control messages identified, remove or comment
# out the next if ... fi block.
